# r-libraries-in-c
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It includes an effective data handling and storage facility, a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools
for data analysis. We aim to develop R libraries to deliver good performance, it will support
basic form operations and understanding the space time complexity in different platforms.

The objective is to :-
1) Develop  R libraries in C
2) Visualization of data points
3) Comparative study of space time complexity on different platforms
